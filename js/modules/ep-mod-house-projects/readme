User selects filter input:

1. FilterView listening to 'change' DOM event invokes its 'onChange' method
2. FilterView 'onChange' method calls this view model method 'setValue'
   or 'unsetValue'
3. Model 'setValue' or 'unsetValue' method triggers 'valueChange' event
   on itself
4. Collection, listening to its models 'valueChange' event, captures the fired
   event and invokes its handler 'onFilterValueChange'
5. Collection method 'onFilterValueChange' triggers 'filterValueChange'
   on itself
6. FiltersView listens to its collection event 'filterValueChange', captures
   this event and invokes its handler 'onFilterValueChange'
7. Handler 'onFilterValueChange' sets one time event 'countPrefFilteredProjects'
   listener ( later : updates submit button text on resolve )
8. Handler 'onFilterValueChange' triggers 'filterSelectChange' on its
   FiltersView
9. ProjectsView listening to FiltersView event 'filterSelectChange' invokes
   projects collection method 'getPreFilteredLength' which return number of
   prefiltered projects
10.FiltersView handler updates submit button text with number of projects
